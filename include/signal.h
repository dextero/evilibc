 * The last bit is a bit problematic. I'd really like to use some arbitrary
 * values that happen to be forbidden for functions, but it doesn't seem like
 * functions need to be aligned in any particular way.
 *
 * Setting them to pointers to some pre-defined functions may also not work
 * if linkers decide they look similar to user-defined ones and merge them.
 *
 * The only way of defining them I can see is leveraging the fact that a first
 * memory page is inaccessible on Linux. TODO?
