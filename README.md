# evilibc

Work-in-progress C standard library implementation that aims to be as counterintuitive and underhanded as possible while still being technically correct (conforming to C11 standard).

## Why?

* To see what can one actually rely on when attempting to write portable code.
* To get to know libc better.
* Because [technically correct is the best kind of correct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hou0lU8WMgo).
* To be able to say "I implemented libc once. It had an undefined behavior handler.".
